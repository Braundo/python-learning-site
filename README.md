At this point, this is more or less a "scratch pad" for organizing my Python learning curriculum. If you find the site, linked content, or any of this source code helpful - great!

This code is currently hosted live at [pythonlearning.io](https://www.pythonlearning.io/).

## To Do

- [x] ~~Break out JavaScript and CSS into their own files~~
- [x] ~~Have the **Reset Progress** button toggle it's style in light mode~~
- [x] ~~Update dark mode/light mode toggle icons~~
- [ ] Implement `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs to maintain progress state between browser refreshes
- [ ] Update mobile checkmarks to fill box instead of checkmark
- [ ] Add a Kubernetes learning plan (longer term goal)
