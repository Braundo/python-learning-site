# Python Learning Site

At this point, this is more or less a "scratch pad" for organizing my Python learning curriculum. If you find the site, linked content, or any of this source code helpful - great!

This code is currently hosted live at [pythonlearning.io](https://pythonlearning.io/).

## To Do

- [ ] Implement `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs to maintain progress state between browser refreshes
- [ ] Break out JavaScript and CSS into their own files
- [ ] Add a Kubernetes learning plan (longer term goal)
- [ ] Have the `Reset Progress` button toggle it's style in light mode (maybe?)
